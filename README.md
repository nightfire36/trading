# Trading

The running application is available at address: <a href="http://tradingplatform.pl/">TradingPlatform.pl</a>

To develop application several technologies were used:
1. Java with Spring & Hibernate - backend of the application was created in Java (see <a href="src/main/java/com/platform/trading">Java</a>)
2. JavaServer Pages (JSP) - to dynamically add some content on server side (see <a href="src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views">JSP</a>)
3. JavaScript - trading panel is generated dynamically by JavaScript (see <a href="src/main/webapp/scripts">JS</a>)
4. Bootstrap - to make application look fancy (see <a href="src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views">Bootstrap</a>)
5. MySQL - to create database containing information about users, opened positions, closed positions & pending orders (see <a href="creating%20MySQL%20tables.txt">SQL database</a>)
6. JUnit & Mockito - for unit tests (see <a href="src/test/java/com/platform/trading">tests</a>)
